What the project does:
      URL Indexer is a tool to index specific files within given folders. The program scans folder contents and populates them into an array list and then added to string URLlist and printed to a text box. 
      Buttons are added to cycle between the various file types contained within the folder and to print file paths.  

Why the project is useful:
      This is a concept that had been done before and done much better (Total Commander for example). However When I worked in Veritas we needed a tool that would give us all of the file tyes contained within a folder for quick access
      as we were dealing with a large amount of content building the Veritas website and this helped save time looking for all png/img/html etc within a folder and gave us the paths to them. These folders were contained within Adobe's CQ6 CMS so running searches in them were difficult as CQ6 did have this functionality nor was it able to categorize the file types.

How users can get started with the project:
     Again along with the Web Crawler these were designed as part of a suite of tools for Veritas and so could be adapted in many ways. The tools were designed around the needs of the company at the time and were built with time saving in mind. I could have used third party tools for this however I wanted to take on the challenge and put my skills to the test.
